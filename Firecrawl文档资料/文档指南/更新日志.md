We have updated the `/extract` endpoint to now be asynchronous. When you make a request to `/extract`, it will return an ID that you can use to check the status of your extract job. If you are using our SDKs, there are no changes required to your code, but please make sure to update the SDKs to the latest versions as soon as possible.

For those using the API directly, we have made it backwards compatible. However, you have 10 days to update your implementation to the new asynchronous model.

For more details about the parameters, refer to the docs sent to you.

![Actions](https://www.firecrawl.dev/images/actions.png)

### Introducing Actions

Interact with pages before extracting data, unlocking more data from every site!

Firecrawl now allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.

- Version 1.5.x of the Node SDK now supports type-safe Actions.
- Actions are now available in the REST API and Python SDK (no version bumps required!).

Here is a python example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.

```python
from firecrawl import Firecrawl

app = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Scrape a website:
scrape_result = app.scrape_url('firecrawl.dev',
    params={
        'formats': ['markdown', 'html'],
        'actions': [
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "click", "selector": "textarea[title=\"Search\"]"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "write", "text": "firecrawl"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "press", "key": "ENTER"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},
            {"type": "click", "selector": "h3"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},
            {"type": "screenshot"}
        ]
    }
)
print(scrape_result)
```
